A library for working with neural nets in golang. It is barely started, you should probably ignore it just now.



Many thanks to:
1. Geoff Hinton and all those who researched neural networks for decades with little encouragement
2. The Golang team
3. Golang by Example
4. http://golang-sizeof.tips/
